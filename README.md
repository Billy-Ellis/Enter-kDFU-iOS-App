# Enter-kDFU-iOS-App
A springboard icon that when clicked, puts your device into kDFU mode.

Yes, this is device specific. This app only works for iPhone3,1 iOS 7.1.2. It requires a pwnediBSS to be located at /. To create a pwnediBSS for your device (if you aren't using iPhone3,1) you can follow a tutorial from Odysseus. It involves creating a custom IPSW and extracting the pwnediBSS from there. You can only create a custom IPSW if you have a 32bit device with firmware keys publicly available.

Also requires kloader to work.

Thanks to @f4bul1z3r on Twitter for the runasroot binary used in this app!
